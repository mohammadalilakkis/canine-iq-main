# Setup instructions (when you receive this project as a zip)

Follow these steps so the app runs with the latest code and keyboard behavior:

1. **Unzip** the project to a folder on your computer.

2. **Open a terminal** in that project folder (e.g. Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).

3. **Install dependencies**  
   Run one of:
   - `bun install` (if you use Bun)
   - `npm install` (if you use Node/npm)

4. **Start the app**  
   Run one of:
   - `bun run start:expo:lan`
   - `npm run start:expo:lan`

5. **Open in Expo Go** on your phone  
   - Make sure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi‑Fi**.  
   - In the terminal you’ll see a QR code or a URL (e.g. `exp://192.168.x.x:8081`).  
   - Scan the QR code with your phone camera, or enter the URL in Expo Go.

6. **Reload the app**  
   In Expo Go: shake your device and tap **Reload**, or close the app and open it again. This ensures you’re running the latest bundle.

7. **If the keyboard still overlaps a field**  
   Please note and send back:
   - Your **phone and OS** (e.g. “Android 14, Samsung” or “iPhone, iOS 17”).
   - **Which screen and which field** (e.g. “Log Activity → Current Weight”, “Login → Password”).

That information helps fix it for your device.
